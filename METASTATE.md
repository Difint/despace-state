We, web3 natives, live in a metastate. 

Network state proposed the idea, metastate is how the idea was implemented. It's already here. We have a group of people, digital nomads, univeted by same stories - metanation.

We have economy, so we do not have territory. 


Sovereign states failed. They lead to coordination failure, they require sacrifices to continue functioning.

Let's address several issues in a row:
1. Regen City
2. Out of Pacific Garbage Patch
3. To create infrastructure, to settle the Moon

While such idea may sound crazy, it's definitely doable.
