# Introducing Cosmic *Carma* *
*Carma spelled correctly*

Quadratic Funding (QF), and Gitcoin pushes public goods forward. One of the hottest topics - participation incentivation and contributors recognition.

Lot of amazing tools like hypercerts were introduced, however it has it's limitations, particularly nontransferable limits it applications for participants.

With that in mind 

## Let's discuss the following framework

1. Cosmic Carma (CCARMA) is a ERC-20 token
2. It has no value, or utility, it has only issuing rules

## Issuing rules

1. Rule 0: Select basic currency, e.g. ETH
2. CCARMA is issued (in equal emount in ETH):
	1. Rule 1: To those who transferred tokens to QF matching pool
	2. Rule 2: To donors who donated to projects on the round
	3. Rule 3: To projects for each donations raised, or transaction from matching pool

Such a simple framework, and its variations (particulaly Rule 3 is highly debatable), could result in interesting behaviours, e.g. CCARMA Leaderboards (like we see with many differenent independent Dashboards on Gitcoin), and would give a tool for recognition of efforts put into the ecosystem by contributors.
